        <h2>     </h2>

        <h4>About Bloodhounds</h4>
        <p>Bloodhounds are a working breed. They need a ton of exercise, both mental and physical. They are not a lazy dog that will just lay around on the porch or the couch like you see on tv. If they don’t get proper exercise and training they can be really destructive. I saw someone the other day say if you don’t give your dog a job they will pick their own job. If you like to spend your days relaxing on the couch, I probably wouldn’t pick a bloodhound. I do think Bloodhounds are some of the most adorable puppies on the planet. This is what seems to get everyone into trouble lol. It is hard to resist those sweet little faces🐶 That sweet squishy puppy stage sure doesn’t last long though lol!<br>
        <br>
        <h4>Temperament & Adaptability</h4>
        <p>.Bloodhounds are also affectionate, loyal, sensitive, intelligent, they are comedians and will make you laugh all day, they have hearts of gold if treated with love! Bloodhounds are not for everyone... but once you are owned by and love a bloodhound, it is hard to have just one!!!!!! Its temperament should always be friendly, and never vicious, moody or harsh, and would only become so if the owners lead the dog to believe he is pack leader over humans. It is mild but not timid; very affectionate with its master and friendly with children. It can be a bit stubborn with meek owners and needs a firm, confident, and consistent owner who displays natural authority over the dog. Dogs need to know the rules of the house and have the humans stick to them. Housebreaking is difficult, but they do well with patient, gentle training. With proper training, they are obedient, but when they pick up an interesting smell, it's sometimes hard to get their attention, as they like to follow their noses and may not even hear you calling them back.  </p>
        <br> 
        <h4>Living Conditions</h4>
        <p>Bloodhounds will do okay in an apartment. They are very inactive indoors but outdoors they will run for hours in play if given the chance. They will do okay without a yard, but should be given plenty of opportunities to run and play to keep healthy and trim. To keep the bloodhounds healthy, it should be given plenty of exercise, including a long daily walk to keep the dog mentally stable, but discourage it from jumping and stressing the front legs. This breed will run and play by the hour when given the chance. Because of their keen noses they tend to roam when they pick up a scent. Take care when off lead that the dog is in a safe area. When they pick up a scent they may not even hear you calling them back as their complete focus will be on finding the critter at the other end.  </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Grooming</h4>
        <p>The Bloodhound is a scent hound and so it is built low to the ground with many flaps and wrinkles and long ears. Many of the scent hounds have large heavy lips and tend to drool. Noses of scent hounds are Very sensitive and shampoos with too much fragrance and dips should be avoided unless absolutely needed. They should be groomed every 4 – 6 weeks to clean ears, clip nails and check anal glands.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Puppy Training</h4>
        <p>We raise our puppies on a strict PUPPY IMPRINTING training method which includes: At four weeks introduce a puppy litterbox; at six weeks move litterbox outside petdoor; and at eight weeks introducing a handful of litter on the ground teaches puppy to go to that spot for potty. We give the first bath and clip toenails at 21 days, and every week after that. At six weeks our puppies take their first car ride. At eight weeks we introduce other pets including cats. We have found that these steps all lead to a well adjusted puppy. You should have a plan in place to continue your pug puppie's training process.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Is the puppy up-to-date on vaccinations?</h4>
        <p>Yes! Our puppies are up to date on appropriate shots and vaccines. On puppy pick up day, you will receive of all vet records, health info, microchip info and copies of deposit and bill of sale contracts. We also provide you with paperwork that includes their birthday and dates of their vaccinations and dewormer as your vet will want to see this info at your first check up appointment.</p>
        <br>   
        <h4>What food can i expect to feed my puppy?</h4>
        <p>We are feeding our adult males and females Royal Canin Small Adult dry food. We are feeding our puppies and nursing mom's Royal Canin Small Puppy dry food.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Will our puppy get along with our lifestyle? (Kids, house, yard, other pets)</h4>
        <p>Picking the perfect puppy is an important decision. Different breeds are suited to different lifestyles. Here are a few things to take into consideration: exercise needs, grooming needs, age of family members, and what activities you want to do with your puppy. For example, if you work out of the home, live in a city high-rise apartment or condo, perhaps you would prefer a dog with low exercise requirements. If you have small children, making sure that you bring a puppy home that is sturdy and well-adjusted will allow your children to enjoy their puppy into their maturity. Puppies can be brought into homes with children as long as they are introduced gradually and firm rules are placed on behavior that will be allowed -- for both the puppy and the other family members. Giving your new puppy its own crate will give it a safe place to go in case other members of the family are too rambunctious or it just needs to nap. We give the same advice to owners of multiple pets who are thinking about bringing home another puppy.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Will my puppy be a show dog?</h4>
        <p>Many of our dogs are from show lines and most of our dogs have champion bloodlines. Our puppies are all good representatives of their breed, being sound in mind and body. We do not, however, sell our puppies as show prospects, as it takes a long time and a lot of training to guarantee a show dog. Any dog with the proper registry can be shown in the breed ring as long as it does not have any disqualifying faults, but dogs must conform to the parent club's breed standard. Few puppies born (even to show dogs!) achieve this. If you would like to show your puppy in obedience, agility, or therapy, they are certainly suited to this purpose. Some breeds are naturally more gifted in these areas, but with training and patience, showing your dog in "team sports" (those with the owner and dog working together) can be fun and rewarding for both of you. We strongly urge  encourage you and your puppy to participate in Puppy classes. Please keep us informed of your successes! We love to hear about your achievements.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Do You Require A Contract? Are they Guaranteed?</h4>
        <p>Yes & Yes, We have a contract Prepared for each puppy that we sell, when full deposit is paid on the pup of your choice you will receive your contract. We Guarantee our pups for two years against any gentic defects. There is much more detail in the contract. Which a basic copy can be read on the Puppy Contract tab.</p>
        <br> 
        <h4>When should I take my puppy to the vet?</h4>
        <p>Before we send any puppy to their new home, we take them to our vet for what we call a "well baby check." This check ensures that your puppy is shipped to you without visible infirmities at the time they leave our home. With our health and genetic guarantee, we require you to take your puppy to the vet within three (3) business days of receiving your puppy. At this visit you will have the opportunity to get your own vet's check-up as well as review the vaccinations your puppy has already received and the ones it will need in the future. In order for our guarantees to be valid, you MUST take your puppy to your vet within three (3) business days of purchase.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Where should my puppy sleep?</h4>
        <p>There are a lot of different schools of thought regarding where your puppy should sleep. We strongly encourage you to provide a crate for your puppy to sleep in. By letting your puppy sleep in a crate, it allows your puppy to have a safe and private place for them, and you will have the knowledge that the puppy cannot roam or chew on dangerous or expensive items through the night. Make sure that your puppy has plenty of food, fresh water and exercise. His crate will soon become his own bed, and he will enjoy sleeping there when tired, even when the door is not shut. If you want your puppy to sleep in your bed, that is entirely up to you and whoever may already share your bed. There is no "right or wrong" answer however, as stated above, we do recommend that your puppy sleep in its own bed at least until they are housetrained and past the teething stage so that they do not get into trouble while they are unsupervised.</p>

        <h3>Are all your dogs pure bred?</h3>
        <p>Yes! All our pups are to 100% pure bred and we can provide you with a 4-7 generation pedigree for each dog! We adore this beautiful breed and would never cross-breed to achieve one of these "designer-breeds"</p>
